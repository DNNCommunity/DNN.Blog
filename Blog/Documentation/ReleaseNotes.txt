	<h3>About the Core Blog</h3>
	<p class="Owner">
		<strong>Version 5.0.0 (Beta 2)</strong><br /><br />
		This version of the module requires DotNetNuke Core 6.2 Beta 2 or greater. <br /><br />
		FYI: Developers should be aware that the module uses Visual Studio 2010 only. <br /><br />

		Release Highlights:
		<ul>
			<li>Corrected blog comment sorting problem.</li>
			<li>20228 - Integrated with the core Journal API.</li>
			<li>20789, 21988 - wired in fix submitted by J Sheely around blank author names.</li>
			<li>20210 - Updated manifest to 5.0 format (from 3.0).</li>
			<li>Automated packaging and made project structure more inline with other DotNetNuke modules and projects.</li>
			<li>Converted module to use DNN 6 form pattern (also removed h1, h2 and font-family styling from module.css).</li>
			<li>Changed all jQuery registration to use proper core methods (now loads jQuery UI too).</li>
			<li>Offloaded most script and css loading to Client Dependency Framework.</li>
			<li>20211 - Integrated core taxonomy & folksonomy.</li>
			<li>Implemented tagging controls and styling form Q&A module.</li>
			<li>19321 - Updated Page Meta information in several views, so the title, description and keywords associated with the 'page' are much more accurate than before (before, we used core page info).</li>
			<li>Added Open Graph Protocol Support to several views.</li>
			<li>Made comment time stamps use friendly date format (x hours/days ago).</li>
			<li>20935 - Corrected column drop bug seen in upgrades to 4.1.0.</li>
			<li>Updated CookComputing.XmlRpcV2.dll</li>
			<li>Added new social sharing option, big 4 only, same as it was done in Q&A.</li>
			<li>Replaced custom tag cloud with Rad Tag Cloud (and now wired into core folksonomy).</li>
			<li>21730, 20946 - Changed how blog post counts are calculated (for display in blog list).</li>
			<li><strong>NEW</strong></li>
			<li>22459 - Now showing comment link and count to unauthenticated users.</li>
			<li>21252 - Cleaned up HTML and CSS in normal user views (changed from table layout to divs, removed unnecessary styling, moved archive out into its own file).</li>
			<li>Replaced dnn tree view (for category selection) with Telerik Treeview.</li>
			<li>Corrected index problems on category and tag tables (even though they will eventually be removed), to avoid maintenance problems.</li>
			<li>20215 - Removed ShareBadge Pro and added option for AddThis (which allows complete customization), in addition to big 4 I already added.</li>
			<li>Added user image and profile link to blog description, added author profile section to entry view.</li>
			<li>Corrected TimeZone problems and module is now based on user profile settings (not a per blog setting).</li>	
			<li>19021, 20865 - Added support for "Ghost Writer" via a new module permission as well as "Blogger" permissions.</li>
			<li>Disabled partial rendering throught all parts of the module. All previous 'benefits' are now handled client-side (show, hide, etc.) with less overhead and trips to the server.</li>
			<li>Reduced the number of module definitions and exposed the same functionality through existing pieces, also took a similar approach and simplified per blog (and module level) settings.</li>
			<li>Added paging support to the module (initial 'home' view doesn't display any paging, by design).</li>
			<li>Corrected problems found in SQL Azure installs.</li>
			<li>Removed 'recent entries' module definition. The same functionality (even more advanced than what was available) is provided today using the Journal and Journal type filters.</li>
		</ul>

		Known Issues:
		<ul>
			<li>Comments look a bit odd. Awaiting Journal functionality not available in core 6.2 Beta 2.</li>
			<li>Recent comments missing (this is related to the item above).</li>
			<li>Author images look different from others seen in social.</li>
			<li>Social Sharing module options are not properly wired in.</li>
			<li>IUpgradeable migration not finished (for taxonomy and entry addeddate conversion to UTC).</li>
			<li>Needs updates for narrow designs (responsive would be great), as well as some styles  (tags & calendar mostly in dark skins).</li>
		</ul>
